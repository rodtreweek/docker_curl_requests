# docker_curl_requests
This is my place for "indexing" various curl commands/requests I've found useful for interacting with different endpoints currently offered through the Docker API. I've only recently started exploring, but am quickly finding that I've needed a place to start dumping these, since "ctrl + r" isn't quite cutting it now ;)

Good read: https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.2/reference/api/
